---

## 🎯 Positioning Statement

**Mondoshawan is the improved implementation of PYRAX's innovative TriStream + GhostDAG architecture, with critical fixes and missing features added.**

---

## 📋 What We Fixed from PYRAX

### 1. Tokenomics Fixes ✅

**PYRAX's Problem**:
- 65% pre-mine (65 billion tokens)
- 15% presale
- 10% team allocation
- No max supply
- No halving

**Mondoshawan's Fix**:
- ✅ 0% pre-mine (fair launch)
- ✅ 0% presale
- ✅ 0% team allocation
- ✅ 10 billion max supply
- ✅ Halving every 4 years
- ✅ 10% development fund (governance-controlled)

### 2. Security Additions ✅

**PYRAX's Missing**:
- No post-quantum cryptography
- No AI security
- No MEV protection
- Basic security only

**Mondoshawan's Addition**:
- ✅ Native post-quantum crypto (Dilithium3, SPHINCS+)
- ✅ AI-driven fraud detection
- ✅ Protocol-level MEV protection
- ✅ Verkle trees for stateless validation

### 3. Governance Implementation ✅

**PYRAX's Missing**:
- No governance system
- No node longevity
- No algorithm rotation
- No community control

**Mondoshawan's Addition**:
- ✅ Node longevity tracking
- ✅ Hardware fingerprinting
- ✅ Algorithm rotation voting
- ✅ Hybrid voting model (token + longevity)

### 4. Trust & Transparency ✅

**PYRAX's Problem**:
- Low trust score (0/100)
- Unknown code availability
- Presale structure
- Unknown team

**Mondoshawan's Fix**:
- ✅ Open source code
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ No presale
- ✅ Transparent tokenomics
- ✅ Fair launch

### 5. Sustainability ✅

**PYRAX's Problem**:
- No development fund
- No long-term funding
- Unlimited inflation
- No sustainability plan

**Mondoshawan's Fix**:
- ✅ 10% development fund
- ✅ Governance-controlled
- ✅ Max supply cap
- ✅ Halving mechanism
- ✅ Long-term sustainability
