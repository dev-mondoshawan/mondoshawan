## 💡 Funding Options (Ranked by Fairness)

### Option 1: Community Presale (Most Fair) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Model**: Small, transparent presale with strict limits

**Structure**:
- **Total Allocation**: 2-5% of max supply (200M-500M MSHW)
- **Price**: Fixed price (e.g., $0.001 per MSHW)
- **Limits**: 
  - Max 1% per address (10M MSHW)
  - Minimum: 1,000 MSHW
  - Maximum: 10M MSHW per address
- **Use of Funds**: 
  - 50% Security audits
  - 25% Exchange listings
  - 15% Marketing/community
  - 10% Infrastructure/legal
- **Transparency**: 
  - Public wallet addresses
  - Monthly spending reports
  - Governance oversight

**Pros**:
- ✅ Community-funded (not team allocation)
- ✅ Transparent and auditable
- ✅ Small percentage (2-5% vs PYRAX's 15%)
- ✅ Strict limits prevent whale dominance
- ✅ Funds development without compromising fairness

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Still a "presale" (but much smaller than PYRAX)
- ⚠️ Requires legal compliance (KYC/AML may be needed)

**Fairness Score**: 9/10

---

### Option 2: Development Fund Pre-Allocation

**Model**: Allocate development fund upfront, but lock it

**Structure**:
- **Allocation**: 10% of max supply (1B MSHW) locked in smart contract
- **Vesting**: 
  - 0% at launch
  - 20% after 6 months
  - 40% after 12 months
  - 60% after 18 months
  - 100% after 24 months
- **Use**: Same as development fund (audits, listings, etc.)
- **Governance**: Multi-sig wallet, community voting

**Pros**:
- ✅ No presale needed
- ✅ Funds available immediately (via loans against locked tokens)
- ✅ Maintains fair launch (tokens not sold pre-launch)
- ✅ Transparent allocation

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Still "pre-allocated" (though locked)
- ⚠️ May need to borrow against locked tokens
- ⚠️ Less flexible than presale

**Fairness Score**: 8/10

---

### Option 3: Community Donations + Grants

**Model**: Accept donations, apply for grants, no token sale

**Structure**:
- **Donations**: Accept MSHW donations (after launch) or fiat/crypto
- **Grants**: Apply for blockchain grants (Ethereum Foundation, etc.)
- **Crowdfunding**: Kickstarter-style campaign for specific goals
- **Transparency**: Public donation addresses, regular reports

**Pros**:
- ✅ 100% fair launch (no pre-allocation)
- ✅ Community-driven
- ✅ No legal complexity
- ✅ Maintains purity

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Unpredictable funding
- ⚠️ May not raise enough
- ⚠️ Slower growth

**Fairness Score**: 10/10 (but risky)

---

### Option 4: Hybrid Model (Recommended) ⭐

**Model**: Combine community presale + development fund

**Structure**:
- **Community Presale**: 3% of supply (300M MSHW)
  - Fixed price: $0.001 per MSHW
  - Max 10M MSHW per address
  - Total raise: ~$300,000
- **Development Fund**: 10% of block rewards (as planned)
- **Use Presale Funds For**:
  - Security audit: $100,000
  - Exchange listings: $75,000
  - Marketing: $50,000
  - Infrastructure: $50,000
  - Legal/compliance: $25,000

**Pros**:
- ✅ Small presale (3% vs PYRAX's 15%)
- ✅ Fair limits (max 10M per address)
- ✅ Transparent use of funds
- ✅ Development fund continues long-term
- ✅ Balanced approach

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Still requires presale (but much smaller)
