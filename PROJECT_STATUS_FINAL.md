## ⚠️ Areas Requiring Attention

### 1. Node Longevity Verification
**Status**: Code implemented, needs thorough testing

**Required**:
- [ ] 30-day eligibility threshold test
- [ ] 31-day offline reset test
- [ ] Sybil attack prevention test

**Timeline**: Pre-testnet (1-2 weeks)

---

### 2. Post-Quantum Signature Weight
**Status**: Implementation complete, impact not measured

**Required**:
- [ ] Block propagation monitoring
- [ ] Real-world TPS measurement
- [ ] Network bandwidth tracking

**Timeline**: During testnet (ongoing)

**Expected Impact**: 20-30% TPS reduction with high PQ usage

---

### 3. Governance Participation
**Status**: System designed, incentivization needed

**Required**:
- [ ] Voting reward implementation
- [ ] Dev Fund usage plan
- [ ] Community outreach

**Timeline**: Pre-testnet planning, testnet implementation

**Strategy**: Use 10% Dev Fund to incentivize voting

---

### 4. Hardware Fingerprinting Privacy
**Status**: Placeholder implemented, full ZK needed

**Priority**: High (privacy-conscious users)

**Timeline**: 4 weeks for full zk-SNARK implementation

**Recommendation**: Ship testnet with IP-based, add ZK in v1.1
