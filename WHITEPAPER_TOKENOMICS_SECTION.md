## 7. Tokenomics and Distribution Model

### 7.1 Overview

The Mondoshawan Protocol implements a **hybrid fair launch model** that balances community funding needs with fair distribution principles. The tokenomics model ensures long-term sustainability while maintaining the fairest launch structure in the industry.

**Key Principles**:
- **97% Fair Launch**: 97% of tokens generated through mining
- **3% Community Presale**: Small pre-mine for community development funding
- **0% Team Allocation**: No tokens allocated to founders or team
- **10% Development Fund**: Long-term sustainability from mining rewards
- **10 Billion Max Supply**: Hard cap ensures scarcity
- **4-Year Halving**: Reduces inflation over time

---

### 7.2 Token Generation Model

#### 7.2.1 Mining-Based Generation (Fair Launch)

The primary mechanism for token generation is **block mining**. Tokens are created as rewards when miners successfully mine blocks across the three mining streams.

**Generation Process**:
```
Block Creation → Token Generation → Reward Distribution
```

**Stream-Specific Generation**:
- **Stream A (ASIC)**: 50 MSHW per block, 10-second intervals
- **Stream B (CPU/GPU)**: 20 MSHW per block, 1-second intervals
- **Stream C (ZK Proofs)**: 5 MSHW per block, 100-millisecond intervals

**Daily Generation (Year 1)**:
- Stream A: ~432,000 MSHW/day (50 MSHW × 8,640 blocks)
- Stream B: ~1,728,000 MSHW/day (20 MSHW × 86,400 blocks)
- Stream C: ~4,320,000 MSHW/day (5 MSHW × 864,000 blocks)
- **Total**: ~6,480,000 MSHW/day from mining

**Fair Launch Percentage**: 97% of total supply (8.7 billion MSHW) generated through mining

---

#### 7.2.2 Community Presale Allocation (Pre-mine)

To fund initial development, security audits, and exchange listings, a **3% community presale** is conducted before mainnet launch.

**Allocation Details**:
- **Total Allocation**: 300,000,000 MSHW (3% of 10 billion max supply)
- **Purpose**: Community development funding
- **Distribution**: Sold to community members (not team, not VCs)
- **Price**: $0.001 per MSHW (fixed)
- **Target Raise**: $300,000 USD
- **Limits**: 1,000 - 10,000,000 MSHW per address (prevents whale dominance)

**Pre-mine Justification**:
- Smallest pre-mine in the industry (vs competitors' 20-65%)
- Community-funded (not team-funded)
- Transparent allocation and spending
- Necessary for initial development and security audits

**Fair Launch Impact**: 3% pre-mine means 97% fair launch (still fairest in industry)

---

### 7.3 Total Supply and Distribution

#### 7.3.1 Max Supply Cap

**Total Supply**: 10,000,000,000 MSHW (10 billion)

**Hard Cap Rationale**:
